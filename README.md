Task 2 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this task, I explored the Titanic dataset to understand the patterns and relationships between features. The goal was to find insights that could be useful for future predictions.

What I did:
- Calculated summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation
- Plotted histograms and boxplots to understand distributions and spot outliers
- Created a correlation heatmap to examine how features relate to each other
- Observed that gender and passenger class had an impact on survival rates

Tools used:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Outcome:
I gained a deeper understanding of the dataset, which is a crucial step before building any machine learning model. Visuals and statistics helped identify which features are most important.
